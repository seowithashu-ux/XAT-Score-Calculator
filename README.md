- Accounting for **negative marking**

5. Receive an **estimated overall score**  

Advanced calculators may also show **expected percentile range** based on previous XAT trends.


## Interpreting Your XAT 2026 Score

- **30–34 Score** – Competitive for multiple top B-schools  
- **25–29 Score** – Mid-tier colleges with strong profiles  
- **Below 25** – Consider alternative B-schools or reattempt planning  

> Remember: final shortlisting depends on **sectional cut-offs, profile, and interviews**, not just the score.
